            <iframe src="html/volatility_analysis.html" style="height: 940px"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Volatility Analysis:</strong></p>
            <p>- Tether is very stable with less volatility due to being pegged to the US dollar.<br>
            - On 9/6, when the price of other coins crashed, USDT price increased as traders might flock to stablecoins, which leads to an increase in demand for it.<br>
            - The price for BTC, ETH, and BNB dropped the most on 4/8 (look for reasons behind the crash).<br>
            - Generally, ETH experienced the worst drop and the best jump when prices fluctuated, followed by BNB (excluding stablecoins and BTC).</p>

            <h2> Daily Cumulative Returns </h2>

            - 0%: no change in value<br>
            - 20%: investment has increased by 20%<br>
            - -50%: a loss of 50% of investment</p>
        
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
            
            <p>1) <strong>Ethereum:</strong><br>
            - Return for ETH peaked slightly at the end of April, then crashed below 0% until 20/5.<br>
            - It peaked significantly on 23/5 then started to gradually decline in early June until the end of June before crashing to -28% around the first week of August.<br>
            - It was gradually increasing within August, still below -15% before declining even more in early September to -34%.<br>
            - The price was volatile until mid-October (below -20%).</p>
        
            <p>2) <strong>Binance Coin:</strong><br>
            - It mirrors Ethereum's volatility but performed slightly better from the end of April until 20/5, ranging from 0 to 10%.<br>
            - Return for BNB was the highest on 7/6 (25%), then dropped significantly a week after; the decline mirrors ETH, but BNB performed a little worse.<br>
            - It performed better than ETH in early August until mid-October; the price was volatile, and the loss was slightly less than 0%.</p>
        
            <p>3) <strong>Bitcoin:</strong><br>
            - The return dropped to -10% in early May.<br>
            - It gradually increased to 10% on 21/5.<br>
            - The returns were volatile for a month (still above 0), but gradually crashed below 0 until 9/7.<br>
            - It gradually increased until the returns maintained around 5% for two weeks before declining to -20%.<br>
            - From August to October, the returns were volatile, and loss percentages were below -10%.<br>
            - It performed better than Ethereum, but Binance Coin outperformed it during this period.</p>
        
            <p>4) <strong>USDT:</strong><br>
            - The cumulative return for Tether is gradually decreasing but not as steep as the other three coins.<br>
            - From May to August, the returns maintained slightly below 0; starting in August, it declined in the range of -5% until -10% in mid-September.<br>
            - However, it slowly jumped back to -9% in mid-October.</p>

            <h2> Correlation Matrix </h2>
            <iframe src="html/correlations_analysis.html" style="height: 600px"></iframe>
            <p><strong>Indicator:</strong><br>
            - High positive correlation: close to 1 = they move together<br>
            - Moderate correlation: 0.5 to 0.8<br>
            - Low or No correlation: close to 0 = no relationship</p>
        
            <p><strong>Analysis:</strong></p>
            <p>1) Bitcoin = Binancecoin (0.929) and Ethereum (0.916) have strong positive correlation. BTC moves up; those two would follow.<br>
            - Tether (0.763) has moderate correlation to Bitcoin.<br>
            - USDT is a stablecoin; it might not experience the same volatility as BTC.</p>
        
            <p>2) Ethereum = Bitcoin (0.916) has strong positive correlation.<br>
            - Against Binancecoin (0.863) and Tether (0.874), it has moderate correlation.<br>
            - ETH often moves in tandem with BTC.</p>
        
            <p>3) Tether = Ethereum (0.874), it has close to positive correlation.<br>
            - Against Bitcoin (0.763) and Binancecoin (0.729), they have moderate correlation.<br>
            - USDT (Tether) can be affected by ETH's price movement, but because it's pegged to US dollars, the price doesnâ€™t fluctuate much.</p>
        
            <p>4) Binancecoin = Bitcoin (0.929), it has strong positive correlation.<br>
            - Ethereum (0.863), it's close to positive correlation.<br>
            - Tether (0.729), it has moderate correlation.</p>
